    <p><i>Welcome to VizDex.</i></p>
    <p>I started this site because I believe that the web, at its best, is a vast, open library of passionate voices. And in a time when social media platforms feel… well, a bit wobbly, and the algorithms increasingly dictate what we see, there needs to be a place to rediscover the pure joy of discovery.</p>
    <p>This site is built on the simple truth that RSS isn't dead, and the best way to discover brilliant new data visualization minds is directly from the source. VizDex is your curated compass, guiding you straight to the most insightful, creative, and captivating data viz blogs & newsletters out there.</p>
    <p>As a passionate explorer of the data universe, I'm constantly seeking out those unique voices that make data sing. This is my way of sharing those discoveries and helping us all connect.</p>
    <p>Have a great viz blog? Share it!</p>
